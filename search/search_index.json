Java installation \u00b6 On ubuntu based systems, you can install java by typing: $ sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk For other recipes and systems, refer to the extended java installation notes . Quick install \u00b6 Note The quick install instructions are based on the forked php-java-bridge server . They promote the recommended installation workflow based on Tomcat , a popular servlet container server widely available nowadays (i.e: Digitalocean droplets...) .

To avoid confusion while developing you must keep aware that: Java supports overloading for methods (and constructors). PHP have the multipurpose array for everything, Java does not. See here to learn more. DateTime and timezones are handled differenlty, see here to learn more. Java supports inner classes. See here And remember While array and scalar types (int, string, bool, float) are automatically casted, testing on null and booleans requires the use of $ba->isNull() and $ba->isTrue() methods. See here to learn more. PHP use the :: for static method calls and constants where Java does not . . soluble-japha brings solutions to those problems, but primary reflexes might not work (i.e. you try to call a static java method through the bridge with '::' instead of the regular '->'...) Object instantiation \u00b6 Whenever you want to work with a Java Object you must instantiate it through the $ba->java('[JAVA_FQCN]', $arg1=null, $arg2=null, ...) . Simple constructor \u00b6 <?php $ba = new \\Soluble\\Japha\\Bridge\\Adapter ([ 'driver' => 'Pjb62' , 'servlet_address' => 'localhost:8083/servlet.phpjavabridge' ]); $string = $ba -> java ( 'java.lang.String' , 'Hello world' ); $hash = $ba -> java ( 'java.util.HashMap' , [ 'key1' => $string , 'key2' => 'hello' ]); Tip The [JAVA FQCN] is the fully qualified java class name (case-sensitive) optionally followed by a list of arguments (variadic notation: BridgeAdapter::java(string $javaClass, ...$args) ).* Overloaded constructor \u00b6 In case of multiple constructor signatures (PHP does not have constructor overloading) , look at : <?php $mathContext = $ba -> java ( 'java.math.MathContext' , $precision = 2 ); $bigint = $ba -> java ( 'java.math.BigInteger' , 123456 ); $bigdec = $ba -> java ( 'java.math.BigDecimal' , $bigint , $scale = 2 , $mathContext ); Tip Refer to the BigDecimal constructor to learn how it has been selected from the provided arguments. Methods \u00b6 After creating a java object with $ba->java('[JAVA_FQCN]', $arg1=null, $arg2=null, ...) you can call any public methods on it. Keep it mind that Java supports method overloading , so before calling a method, ensures parameters will match the desired method signature. For example the java.lang.String object exposes two methods for indexOf() <?php $javaString = $ba -> java ( 'java.lang.String' , 'A key is a key!' ); $index = $javaString -> indexOf ( 'key' ); // Will print 2, the selected method is `java.lang.String#indexOf(String str)` $index = $javaString -> indexOf ( 'key' , $fromIndex = 8 ); // Will print 11, the selected method is `java.lang.String#indexOf(String, $fromIndex)` Classes \u00b6 Use the $ba->javaClass('[JAVA FQCN]', $arg1=null, ...) method instead of $ba->java() ... Take a look to the following example with java.lang.System class. <?php $system = $ba -> javaClass ( 'java.lang.System' ); echo $system -> getProperties () -> get ( 'java.vm_name' ); Static methods \u00b6 Static methods are called like regular php methods (no :: ). <?php $calendar = $ba -> javaClass ( 'java.util.Calendar' ) -> getInstance (); Tip Note the use of $ba->javaClass(...) instead of $ba->java(...) to refer to the java class and call the static method on it. Remember to use it whenever you face a factory, singleton or a generic static method. Constants \u00b6 Constants on java classes are called like regular properties (no :: ). <?php // $ba = new BridgeAdapter(...); $tzClass = $ba -> javaClass ( 'java.util.TimeZone' ); echo $tz -> getDisplayName ( false , $tzClass -> SHORT ); Iterables \u00b6 Warning Iterations have a cost on performance, and looping over large sets is highly discouraged. See how you can improve speed with the values() method . You can use standard foreach , while , for ,... to loop over Java iterable objects (Map, Collection, List...). <?php // $ba = new BridgeAdapter(...); $properties = $ba -> javaClass ( 'java.lang.System' ) -> getProperties (); foreach ( $properties as $key => $value ) { echo \" $key : $value\\n \" ; } ArrayAccess \u00b6 Interfaces\\JavaObject implements ArrayAccess which allows to write maps, arrays... in a more convenient way. An example with HashMap : <?php // $ba = new BridgeAdapter(...); $hashMap = $ba -> javaClass ( 'java.util.HashMap' ); $hashMap [ 'test' ] = 'Cool' ; // equivalent to `$hashMap->put('test', 'Cool');` if ( isset ( $hashMap [ 'test' ])) { unset ( $hashMap [ 'test' ]); } Inner classes \u00b6 Java supports inner classes (classes as a class property) . To explicitly refer to an inner class, the FQCN separator must be a $ sign instead of the regular . . The following example makes use of the Calendar.Builder class: <?php // $ba = new BridgeAdapter(...); // NOTICE THE DOLLAR SIGN in 'Calendar$Builder' $builder = $ba -> java ( 'java.util.Calendar$Builder' ); echo $ba -> getClassName ( $builder ); // will print 'java.util.Calendar$Builder' $calendar = $builder -> setCalendarType ( 'gregory' ) -> build (); echo $ba -> getClassName ( $calendar ); // will print 'java.util.GregorianCalendar' Warning As PHP will interpret the $ as a variable, be sure to use single-quotes to hold the class name. Datatypes \u00b6 Scalar types \u00b6 The PHP scalar types: string , int , float and boolean can be sent as parameters to Java methods or constructors transparently: <?php $price = 12.99 ; $quantity = $ba -> java ( 'java.lang.Integer' , 10 ); $jstring = $ba -> java ( 'java.lang.String' , 'Hello world' ); Tip Be aware that Java often use object versions of scalars, like java.lang.String , java.lang.Integer , java.lang.Boolean ... In those cases, remember they generally provides methods to retrieve the scalar value. For example: <?php $quantity = $ba -> java ( 'java.lang.Integer' , 10 ); $total = $quantity -> intValue () * 12.99 ; echo sprintf ( 'Total id %.2f' , $total ); // -> 1299.00 Array types \u00b6 The PHP multi-purpose array has not equivalent in Java and you'll often use Java objects like Map, HashMap, Collection, List, Vector... instead. <?php $array = [ 'name' => 'John Doe' , 'age' => 26 ]; $hashMap = $ba -> java ( 'java.util.HashMap' , $array ); While you can generally send the parameters as a standard php array, to get an array back you can use the fast values() method: <?php // with HashMap $input_array = [ 'name' => 'John Doe' , 'age' => 26 ]; $hashMap = $ba -> java ( 'java.util.HashMap' , $input_array ); $output_array = $ba -> values ( $hashMap ); // $input_array === $output_array // With ArrayList $arrayList = $ba -> java ( 'java.util.ArrayList' ); $arrayList -> add ( 'Hello' ); $arrayList -> add ( 'World' ); $array = $ba -> values ( $arrayList -> toArray ()); // $array == ['Hello', 'World']; or iterate the object (ok for small sets). Testing null and booleans \u00b6 Warning Testing null and boolean: Due to internal proxying between java and php objects, 'null', 'false' and 'true' values must be tested through the bridge object. Otherwise the test is made the php proxied object and not its value. <?php // $ba = new BridgeAdapter(...); $javaBoolean = $ba -> java ( 'java.lang.Boolean' , true ); if ( $ba -> isTrue ( $javaBoolean )) { echo \"Yes, it is.\" ; } $javaBoolean = $ba -> java ( 'java.lang.Boolean' , false ); if ( ! $ba -> isTrue ( $javaBoolean )) { echo \"Yes, it is not.\" ; } if ( ! $ba -> isNull ( $rs )) { $rs -> close (); } Working with dates \u00b6 Warning Dates are not (yet) automatically casted between Java and PHP. Keep in mind that Internally the JVM works with milliseconds, PHP with to microseconds (7.1 introduced milli). Timezones might differs between runtimes. Check your configuration. As an example, the java.util.Date allows creation of dates based on a timestamp expressed in milliseconds : <?php // $ba = new BridgeAdapter(...); $phpDate = \\DateTime :: createFromFormat ( 'Y-m-d' , '2016-12-21' ); $milli = $phpDate -> format ( 'U' ) * 1000 ; // Internally the JVM handles milliseconds // In order to create a new Java date, // php dates must be converted accordingly. // The 'U' allows formatting the date as // microseconds since epoch time, just multiply // by 1000 to get milliseconds. // Alternatively you can use // $milli = strtotime('2016-12-21') * 1000; $javaDate = $ba -> java ( 'java.util.Date' , $milli ); $simpleDateFormat = $ba -> java ( \"java.text.SimpleDateFormat\" , 'yyyy-MM-dd' ); echo $simpleDateFormat -> format ( $javaDate ); // Will print: \"2016-12-21\" Alternatively you can use the java.text.SimpleDateFormatter object to parse the date string without the php conversion. <?php // $ba = new BridgeAdapter(...); $date = '2016-12-21' ; $simpleDateFormat = $ba -> java ( \"java.text.SimpleDateFormat\" , 'yyyy-MM-dd' ); $javaDate = $simpleDateFormat -> parse ( $date ); // This is a Java date echo $simpleDateFormat -> format ( $javaDate ); // Will print: \"2016-12-21\" Timezones \u00b6 Timezones might differ from PHP and the JVM runtimes. In that case, dates between PHP and Java are not guaranteed to be the same (think of 2016-12-31 23:00:00 in London and Paris) In most cases those differences can be easily fixed by ensuring both the JVM and PHP configurations use the same timezone. Another option is to pass the current timezone in the formatter : <?php $pattern = \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm\" ; $formatter = $ba -> java ( \"java.text.SimpleDateFormat\" , $pattern ); $tz = $ba -> javaClass ( 'java.util.TimeZone' ) -> getTimezone ( \"Europe/Paris\" ); $formatter -> setTimeZone ( $tz ); Resources \u00b6 PHP resources like pointer to a file or a network socket cannot be exchanged between runtimes. IO streams \u00b6 Warning For performance, operations on resources (like iterating over a file) is highly discouraged. They should be made on their own environment.
