In short **soluble-japha** allows to write Java code in PHP and interact with the JVM ecosystem.

----

As meaningless examples:

```php
<?php
// Some standard JVM classes
$hashMap = $ba->java('java.util.HashMap', [
        'message' => 'Hello world',
        'value'   => $ba->java('java.math.BigInteger', PHP_INT_MAX)
]);
$hashMap->put('message', '你好，世界');
echo $hashMap->get('message');
```

-------

```php
<?php

use Soluble\Japha\Bridge\Exception;

// An imaginary java library class (i.e. NLP, Android, Jasper, Tensorflow,
// enterprise stuff, esoteric java lib/driver or your own Java class...)
try {
    $javaLib = $ba->java('an.imaginary.JavaLibraryClass', 'param1', 'param2');

    $results = $javaLib->aMethodOnJavaLibExecutedOnTheJVM(
                            // Method parameters
                            $hashMap->get('message'),
                            $ba->java('java.io.BufferedReader',
                                 $ba->java('java.io.FileReader', __FILE__)
                            ),
                            $ba->javaClass('java.util.TimeZone')->SHORT
                        );

    foreach ($results as $key => $values) {
        echo "$key: " . $values[0] . PHP_EOL;
    }
} catch (Exception\ClassNotFoundException $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
} catch (Exception\JavaException $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage() . ' [' . $e->getJavaClassName() . ']';
    echo $e->getStackTrace();
}

```

And if you're wondering what's the `$ba` object, it's a connection
to the java bridge server:

```php
<?php

use Soluble\Japha\Bridge\Adapter as BridgeAdapter;
use Soluble\Japha\Bridge\Exception as BridgeException;

$options = [
    'servlet_address' => 'localhost:8080/MyJavaBridge/servlet.phpjavabridge'
];

try {
    $ba = new BridgeAdapter($options);
} catch (BridgeException\ConnectionException $e) {
    // Server is not reachable
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

## Use cases

**Expand the PHP horizons to the Java ecosystem**, especially whenever you want
to take advantage of

- some compelling libraries *([Jasperreports](http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library), [CoreNLP](http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/), [FlyingSaucer](https://github.com/flyingsaucerproject/flyingsaucer/releases), [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/)...)*
- benefit from JVM performances *([Deeplearning4J](https://deeplearning4j.org/)...)* or wrappers *([TensorFlow Java Api](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/)...)*.
- when a pure-PHP alternative does not exists *(Android, driver, closed api, enterprise...)*
- or simply for the fun of it.

## Features

`soluble-japha` provides a PHP client to interact with the Java Virtual Machine.

- [x] Write Java code from PHP *(in a similar way from equivalent java code)*.
- [x] Keep *programmatic* code control from the PHP side *([function oriented vs REST](#considerations))*.
- [x] Java execution on the JVM ensuring compatibility and efficiency *(proxied objects)*.
- [x] No need to write a service layer prior to usage *(the Java object is the contract)*.
- [x] Fast network based communication between runtimes, no JVM startup effort.
- [x] Solid foundation to create, develop *or publish* PHP wrappers over java libs.


> For user of previous versions, **soluble-japha** client replaces the original/legacy [PHPJavaBridge](http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/pjb/)
> `Java.inc` implementation and has been completely refactored to fit modern practices
> and PHP7.
> See the [differences here](./doc/notes_legacy.md) and the [legacy compatibility layer](https://github.com/belgattitude/soluble-japha-pjb62-compat) if needed.

## Requirements

- Version `^3.0` requires PHP 8.0 ![PHP Version](http://img.shields.io/badge/php-8.0+-ff69b4.svg)
- Version `^2.0` requires PHP 7.1 ![PHP Version](http://img.shields.io/badge/php-7.1+-ff69b4.svg)

> **Important**. There's **NO API BC-BREAK** between v0.13, v1.x, v2.x and v3.x so you should be
> able to upgrade safely between releases. The choice to increment version numbers to drop
> support for older php versions was made to avoid any confusion with multiple php installs.


If you're looking for compatibility with older PHP versions, note that:

- Version `^1.0` requires PHP 5.6 ![PHP Version](http://img.shields.io/badge/php-5.6+-ff69b4.svg) and works with HHVM.
- Version `^0.13` requires PHP 5.5 ![PHP Version](http://img.shields.io/badge/php-5.5+-ff69b4.svg) and works with HHVM.

## Installation

Installation in your PHP project **(client)**

```console
$ composer require soluble/japha
```

## Considerations

> In short, **the bridge shines** whenever you need to use directly a Java library
> within a reasonable number of method calls. Otherwise implement
> **REST or RPC approaches** for first-class system integrations.

The soluble-japha bridge can be seen as a `function oriented` solution in
comparison to `resource oriented` ones *(i.e. REST,...)*. From REST or even
RPC-based solutions *(XMLRPC, JsonRPC or [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc))*,
the bridge skips the need to write a service layer on
the Java side and allows a more *programmatic* approach to PHP developers.

Depending on usage, the benefits of freedom offered by the bridge
can become a limitation in term of performance. Keep in mind that
the bridge is sensitive to the number of objects and method calls
(named `roundtrips`) and if few hundreds of methods calls are
often insignificant (a `roundtrip` is generally less than 0.1ms) going further
its target scenarios can be disappointing. In those case,
traditional approaches like REST should be considered and applied instead.

That said, the bridge is a good, reliable and sometimes preferable alternative
over REST for scenarios where a reasonable number of methods calls is intended.
