### 2.0.0 (2017-06-29)

This release requires PHP7.1 !!!

While major version have been incremented, the api between `v1.4.0` and `2.0.0` has remained the same.
In other words no breaking changes should happen (BC preserved).

### Changed

- Support for PHP7.1 only `declare(strict_types=1)`.

### Fixed

- Minor bugfix with integer cookie encoding due to strict_types

## 1.4.5 (2017-05-29)

- Minor fix and cleanup in `SimpleHttpHandler` channel creation.

### Added

- Parser tests added for invalid xml errors

## 1.4.3 (2017-05-20)

### Fixed

- Temporarily remove phpstan from require-dev. It will be re-added in 2.0 due
  to possible issues with plaform requirements.
  If you want to install, add to your require-dev: `"phpstan/phpstan": "^0.7.0"`
- More typehints fixed or added
- Unit tests autoloading is now fixed.

### 1.4.2 (2017-05-18)

### Fixed

- Fixed some invalid typehints thanks to phpstan !!!

### Added

- New composer scripts for checking source code.

## 1.4.1 (2017-04-26)

### Added

- Created `Soluble\Japha\Bridge\Exception\BrokenConnectionException` to mask
  internal pjb62 drive BrokenConnectionException. Documented in DriverInterface as well.

### Fixed

- Minor issue with `$ba->isInstanceOf($object, $class)` when second arg `class` is
  not a string neither an `Interface\JavaObject`. The exception `Exception\InvalidArgumentException`
  is now thrown (was masked before).

### Improved

- PHPDoc, improved documentation on Exception in DriveInterface and AbstractDriver.

- PHPDoc, magic methods `__call()`, `__get()` and `__set()` nows inform
  about possible exception. Thanks @marcospassos for persisting on this.


## 1.4.0 (2017-04-25)

## Added

- `Interfaces\JavaObject` exposes magic methods `__call()`, `__get()` and `__set()`
   to better reflect that method calls and property accesses
   will be delegated to the remote Java object.

## Changed

- Possible bc-break in undocumented feature. The `DB\DriverManager::getJdbcDSN()` has changed its signature
  and starts now with the driver name. An `$options` array allows to pass extra options.

## Improved

- Serialization with `__sleep()` and `__wakeup()` has preliminary test support

## 1.3.1 (2017-04-23)

This release has been tested with the latest official phpjavabridge 7.1.3.

## Added

- Pjb62\Driver added method `setExitCode(int $code)` from 7.1.3 upstream merge,
  requires PHP 7.1.3+ to be interpreted on the bridge side.

## 1.3.0 (2017-04-23)

## Added

- `Interfaces\JavaObject` now implements `ArrayAccess`
  the following code is possible without calling java methods:

  ```php
  $hashMap = $ba->java('java.util.HashMap');
  $hashMap['key'] = 'cool';
  if (isset($hashMap['key']) {
     echo $hashMap['key'];
     unset $hashMap['key'];
  }
  ```

- Added convenience exception: `NoSuchFieldException`

## Changed

- Possible bc-break in undocumented `Adapter` option: `java_default_timezone`.
  It won't fall back to php default timezone if null. This feature is subject to caution.
- Removed last `func_get_args` uses, replaced by PHP5.6 variadic notation in `AbstractJava` and `JavaException`.
- `Interfaces\JavaObject` now implements `IteratorAggregate`, this behaviour was
  already working but not *statically* stated.

## Documentation

- Setting the default java timezone with `TimeZone.setDefault()` should be avoided
  as its value is global on the JVM.

## 1.2.2 (2017-05-20)

## Improved

- Improved messages on socket errors (errno and errstr)
- Added 'protected' members on relevant methods and attributes. (WIP)
- Improved PHPDoc comments with types (WIP)
- Added additional checks for errors in Client.php.

### Fixed

- Unit tests: Fixed minor issue with mariadb connector in JDBC tests (serverTimezone)

### Added

- Unit tests for inner classes and enumset.

### Removed

- Removed Client::createParserString and moved the code into SimpleParser *(only used by HHVM)*.
  If you rely by mistake on this method, it can be replaced by `new ParserString()`, not considered
  as a bc-break because this method is only used by hhmv xml parser and was not documented.

### Documentation

- Added documentation for inner class support.
- Added recipes for gson, json-io serialization.


## 1.2.1 (2017-03-21)

### Fixed

- Minor fix, wrong message referring to legacy `java_inspect` and `java_values`.

## 1.2.0 (2017-03-06)

### Added

- New driver methods: `setFileEncoding()` and `getConnectionOptions()` currently internal use only.
- Support for php-java-bridge 7.0.0.
- Possibility to call servlet methods from the driver `$ba->getDriver()->invoke(null, 'myMethod', [$params])`.

### Improved

- Set utf-8 by default for html_special_chars (no need to set in php.ini)
- Replaces array_push($arr, $val) by $arr[] = $val for little perf improvement in Driver
- Removed devDependency on devster/ubench for simple benchmarks.

### Fixed

- Minor: JavaClass::getName() now return string instead og JavaObject(java.lang.String).


## 1.1.1 (2017-03-02)
